                <p>Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its use of significant whitespace. It was
                    created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. Python is a high-level, interpreted
                    programming language known for its simplicity, versatility, and readability.</p>

            <article>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Interpreted Language:</strong> Python code is executed line by line by the Python
                        interpreter, making it easy to debug and test.</li>
                    <li><strong>Easy to Learn and Use:</strong> Python's syntax is simple and easy to understand, making
                        it an ideal language for beginners and experienced developers alike.</li>
                    <li><strong>Readable Syntax:</strong> Python emphasizes readability with its clean and intuitive
                        syntax, using indentation to define code blocks instead of braces.</li>
                    <li><strong>Dynamic Typing:</strong> Python uses dynamic typing, meaning you don't need to declare
                        the type of a variable before using it. This allows for more flexibility but may require careful
                        attention to variable types.</li>
                    <li><strong>Duck Typing:</strong> Focuses on an object's behavior rather than its type. The idea is
                        inspired by the saying "If it looks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck, then
                        it probably is a duck." In Python, this means that the suitability of an object for a particular
                        operation is determined by whether it supports the necessary methods or behaviors, rather than
                        its explicit type.</li>

                <p>Python is open-source, which means its source code is freely available for anyone to use, modify, and
                    distribute. It has a vibrant community of developers who contribute to its development and provide
                    support through forums, mailing lists, and other channels.</p>
